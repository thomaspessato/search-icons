# Fontawesome Search icon functionality

For testing purposes

Easy way to search a fontawesome icon using an input field.

You only need the name of the icon and the file "all.js".

Since each version contains its own icon library, I've choosen to copy the default library (without the branding, etc).

Feel free to use it or change it to become something better for the world.
